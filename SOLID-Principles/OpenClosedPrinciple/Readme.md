### Modification is changing the code of an existing class, and extension is adding new functionality.
### We should be able to add new functionality without touching the existing code for the class.
### This is because whenever we modify the existing code, we are facing the risk of creating potential bugs. So we should avoid touching the tested and reliable production code if possible.
### This requirement can be done with the help of interfaces, inheritence or abstract classes.
