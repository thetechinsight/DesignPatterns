##  This rule means that we should break our interfaces in many smaller ones, so they better satisfy the exact needs of our clients.
</br>

## The principle states that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. Clients should not be forced to implement a function they do no need.
</br>

## Similar to the Single Responsibility Principle, the goal of the Interface Segregation Principle is to minimize the side consequences and repetition by dividing the software into multiple, independent parts.
